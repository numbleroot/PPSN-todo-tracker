# Exemplary Bootstrap usage: ToDo tracker application

Within the scope of one of our university courses ([Programmierpraktikum: Soziale Netzwerke](https://www.cit.tu-berlin.de/menue/teaching/sommersemester_16/programmierpraktikum_soziale_netzwerke_ppsn/)) the first two assignments were to build a very basic ToDo tracker application. Goal of this assignment was to prove understanding of the usage of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and a web framework in a modern language of choice.
