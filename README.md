# Exemplary Bootstrap usage: Static ToDo tracker

Within the scope of one of our university courses ([Programmierpraktikum: Soziale Netzwerke](https://www.cit.tu-berlin.de/menue/teaching/sommersemester_16/programmierpraktikum_soziale_netzwerke_ppsn/)) the first assignment was to build a mockup of what a static ToDo tracker could look like. Goal of this assignment was to prove understanding of the usage of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
